He didn't know why they were there... but they were.
He tried to catch them, but they ran.
He tried to yell, but there was no sound.
He tried to touch, but they are too hot to be close.
His pet donkey was missing and nowhere to be found...was this it?
They sought shelter under the ground.
They sang a lullaby.
His despair was the last drop of rain the cold-blooded Astredeis.
